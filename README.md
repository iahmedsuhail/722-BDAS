# An analysis of gender bias in making traffic stops in Rhode Island.

This study accesses the traffic stop data released by the Stanford Open Policing Project for Gender Discrimination, motivated by the original search for racial discrimination by the team. The motivation behind making the data collected public was to “help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.” The study investigates if police officers are discriminatory based on gender while making a traffic stop, specifically in Rhode Island in the United States of America. The hypotheses, motivated by personal experiences, was that girls are discriminated against when police officers are making stops, and girls are more likely to be stopped when driving. The study aims at concluding, with statistical evidence, if Police Officers in Rhode Island are discriminatory in making traffic stops against a specific gender. The goal is a successful examination and study of the rate at which male and female drivers are stopped and arrested.
